      <description>Goal of the project This project’s goal is to make it easier for anyone to make slides that they want, in any design they want. Essentially it brings customisation to another level because people can start making slide designs if they can describe it and in wayyy less time, so that more time can be spent practising the presentation itself rather than worrying about the design of it.
Explanation of each step of the process Below will be an explanation of why I did each step, I recommend that you go through the how-to-guide first before reading on.</description>
